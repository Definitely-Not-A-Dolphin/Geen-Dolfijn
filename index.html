  <h1>Tervetuloa!</h1>
  <p> 
    Welcome on my personal website! This place is nothing more than a pile of stuff I need to place somewhere, and you, the reader, will be subjected to mathematics and a little programming.
  </p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Derek Verduijn, a 16 year old boy from The Netherlands. I plan on studiyng mathematics after middle school (Dutch Edu system, keep that in mind), and becoming a teacher.
    I've always enjoyed explaining things to others, seeing the moment someone finnaly understands something is a beautiful thing.
  </p>

  <h2>My interests / hobbies</h2>
  <h3><span id="math">Mathematiks</span> and <span id="komputer">Programming</span></h3>
  <p>
    You can find more about these topics in the <a href="https://geen-dolfijn.nl/my-skills">skills page</a>. See you there!
  </p>

  <h3 id="game">Gaming</h3>
  <p>
    I really enjoy games. Metroidvania's are my favorite, and yes I have 112%-ed Hollow Knight and gotten all its achievements.
    Playing with friends is also really important for me, so Lethal Company, Rounds, Bopl Battle and ofcourse Minecraft are lots of fun. 
    I am practising a lot of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, so thats also something I do.
  </p>

  <h3 id="linguist">Linguistiks</h3>
  <p>
    I find linguistiks really interesting, but I haven't done much with it yet. I do think that Ã¾ should make a comeback.
    I do learn Finnish, partly because it is really unique from the other languages that are spoken in Europe.
