          Welcome on my personal website! This place is nothing more than a
          pile of stuff I need to place somewhere, and you, the reader, will
          be subjected to mathematics and my ridiculous opinions about coding.

      <div class="item aboutMe">
        <h2 class="nob not">About Me</h2>
        <p class="not">
          I am Derek Verduijn, a 16 year old dude from The Netherlands. I plan
          on studying mathematics after middle school (Dutch Edu system, keep
          that in mind), and becoming a teacher (or something like that).
          Explaining stuff is cool because you get to see the moment that the
          quarter dropped.

        <h3 id="game" class="nob">Gaming is cool, actually</h3>
        <p class="not">
          I really enjoy games. Metroidvania's are my favorite, and yes I have
          112%-ed Hollow Knight and gotten all its achievements. Playing with
          friends is also really important for me, so Lethal Company, Rounds,
          Bopl Battle and ofcourse Minecraft are lots of fun. I am practising
          a lot of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, so thats also something I do.
        </p>

        <h3 id="linguist" class="nob">Linguistiks</h3>
        <p class="not">
          Linguistics is cool, but I haven't done much with it yet. I do think
          that Ã¾orn should make a comeback. I learn Finnish, partly because it
          is really unique from the other languages that are spoken in Europe,
          and also because I enjoy torture.
