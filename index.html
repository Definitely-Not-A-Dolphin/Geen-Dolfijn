  <h1>Terve!</h1>
  <p1> 
    Welcome on my personal website! This place is nothing more than a pile of stuff I need to place somewhere, and you, the reader, will be subjected to mathematics and a little programming.
  </p1>

  <h2>My skills or sum</h2>
  <h3>Mathematiks</h3>
  <p2>
    I am kinda good at math, and especially like algebra. I would rather want to solve a hexic polynomial than a geometry problem.
  </p2>

  <h3>Komputers</h3>
  <p2>
    I take computer science classes (if you can call them that) in school, so I am familiar with the basics of python. Then I did an fstream-any% so I can make some stuff in C++, but not much. 
    Don't forget that I am a math nerd, so I am also learning MAnim (the stuff 3blue1brown uses to animate his videos).
  </p2>

  <h3>Linguistiks</h3>
  <p2>
    I like linguistics, and thats it. I haven't done anything with it yet, but maybe I'll add something that turns the entire site into the IPA. And there is nothing you can do about it ;)
    I do learn finnish tho.
