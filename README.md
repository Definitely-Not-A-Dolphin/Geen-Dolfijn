# Geen-Dolfijn.nl

Welcome to my personal website! I put a lot of effort into it so I hope you like it!

("geen dolfijn" is Dutch for "not a dolphin")

## What can I find there?

My website features only four pages: home, projects, desmos-gallery and blog channel. It used to have waaaay more, but after V4.0.0 I decided to dim it down a bit. The home page kinda speaks for itself, so I'll run through the rest.

On my [projects page](https://geen-dolfijn.nl/projects) you can find four of my biggest projects, The Finnish Language Trainer, the Breadener bot, the Frog With A Knife bot and this very website. It makes use of the GitHub API for fetching data about the projects, so I don't have to do stats manually.

On the [desmos gallery](https://geen-dolfijn.nl/desmos-gallery) you can find the graphs I made in Desmos that I am the proudest of. I am a big math nerd, so desmos.com is my second home.

On the [blog channel](https://geen-dolfijn.nl/blog-channel) you can find, well, blogs! I try to maintain them regularly, although I cannot say that I am succeeding in that to be honest.

### What stuff makes it work?

This website was made with the SvelteKit framework, with TypeScript instead of JavaScript. The homepage features the _last.fm API_, so it displays the music I am listening to in real time when you visit my site! It also features the _hackatime_ API, so you can see how much time I have logged that day! Then of course I use the _GitHub Octokit API_ for the projects page.
