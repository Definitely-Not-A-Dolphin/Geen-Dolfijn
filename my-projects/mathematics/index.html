          My submission for the 2024 Desmos Art Contest explicitly showed my love for hexagons.
          Bees will go from left to right following some interesting functions that involve trigonometrics, hyperbolic trigonometrics, the error function, and more.

          When I turned 16 years old in december, one of my friends, who is way better with computers than anyone I
          know, gifted
          me this domain.
          Exactly 20 days later, it was ready to acces and for me to use. I plan on submitting this to the <span
            id="komputer">High Seas</span> program when I feel content with the contents and the layout. <br />
          The name of the domain is <span id="linguist">"geen-dolfijn"</span>, which is <span id="linguist">Dutch</span>
          for
          "no-dolphin".
        </p>
        <p class="nob">
          Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
        <ul class="not">
          <li>A better layout. I am content with the simplicity it has now, but I do not think some images or a side bar
            would
            be a bad addition.
          </li>
          <li>
            More pages: I want this website to me an accurate representation of me, so it must include serious and
            non-serious
            things.
          </li>
          <li>
            A way to let you, the reader, try my projects without leaving this very site.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is written in <span id="komputer">HTML</span> and <span id="komputer">CSS</span>, and I have put
          roughly 6
          hours into it.
          My friend Jsw helped me with the setup, and why not check out his GitHub, he has a very cool discord bot: <a
            href="https://github.com/jsw08" id="github">jsw</a>.
          Check out the GitHub repository for <a href="https://github.com/Definitely-Not-A-Dolphin/Geen-Dolfijn"
            id="github">this website</a> here.
