        <p class="not">
          To practise both my <span id="linguist">Finnish</span> and my <span id="komputer">C++</span> skills, I made
          the
          Finnish Language Trainer (Formerly Finnish Idiom Trainer).
          It makes use of <span id="komputer">(i)fstream</span> to store all the words and their translations in
          seperate <span id="komputer">csv-files</span>.
          It currently supports the "first" <span id="linguist">five cases</span> of the Finnish Language: <span
            id="linguist">Nominatiivi, Genetiivi, Akkusatiivi, Partitiivi, Inessiivi.</span>
          There are also some files that store grammar explainations, but they aren't finished. <br />
        </p>
        <p class="nob">
          Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:<br>
          Colors, since everything happens in the terminal, colors can help organising all the text, and it looks
          aesthetically pleasing.
          More grammar explainations: Finnish is known for its <span id="linguist">complex grammar</span>, both for
          <span id="linguist">cases</span> and for <span id="linguist">verbs</span>.
          A way to practise numbers up to a million, but without having to type the first million numbers out in a
          file.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is written in <span id="komputer">C++</span>, and I put roughly 30 hours into it.
          Although his code isn't used anymore, my good friend <a href="https://github.com/wh4ky" id="github">Wh4cky</a>
          wrote
          the first version (the current version is <span id="komputer">4.0.0</span>).

          When I turned 16 years old in december, one of my friends, who is way better with computers than anyone I
          know, gifted
          me this domain.
          Exactly 20 days later, it was ready to acces and for me to use. I plan on submitting this to the <span
            id="komputer">High Seas</span> program when I feel content with the contents and the layout. <br />
          The name of the domain is <span id="linguist">"geen-dolfijn"</span>, which is <span id="linguist">Dutch</span>
          for
          "no-dolphin".
        </p>
        <p class="nob">
          Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:<br>
          A better layout. I am content with the simplicity it has now, but I do not think some images or a side bar
          would be a bad addition.<br>
          More pages: I want this website to me an accurate representation of me, so it must include serious and
          non-serious things.<br>
          A way to let you, the reader, try my projects without leaving this very site.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is written in <span id="komputer">HTML</span> and <span id="komputer">CSS</span>, and I have put
          roughly 6
          hours into it.
          My friend Jsw helped me with the setup, and why not check out his GitHub, he has a very cool discord bot: <a
            href="https://github.com/jsw08" id="github">jsw</a>.
          Check out the GitHub repository for <a href="https://github.com/Definitely-Not-A-Dolphin/Geen-Dolfijn"
            id="github">this website</a> here.

        <h2>Updates: </h2>
        <p>
          25/01/2025: I submitted it to High seas and it got me 101 dablouns!
        </p>
        <p>
          26/01/2025: I replaced most of the links with buttoms!
