        <p class="not">
          To practise both my <span id="linguist">Finnish</span> and my <span id="komputer">C++</span> skills, I made
          the
          Finnish Language Trainer (Formerly Finnish Idiom Trainer).
          It makes use of <span id="komputer">(i)fstream</span> to store all the words and their translations in
          seperate <span id="komputer">csv-files</span>.
          It currently supports the "first" <span id="linguist">five cases</span> of the Finnish Language: <span
            id="linguist">Nominatiivi, Genetiivi, Akkusatiivi, Partitiivi, Inessiivi.</span>
          There are also some files that store grammar explainations, but they aren't finished. <br />
        </p>
        <p class="nob">
          Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:<br>
          Colors, since everything happens in the terminal, colors can help organising all the text, and it looks
          aesthetically pleasing.
          More grammar explainations: Finnish is known for its <span id="linguist">complex grammar</span>, both for
          <span id="linguist">cases</span> and for <span id="linguist">verbs</span>.
          A way to practise numbers up to a million, but without having to type the first million numbers out in a
          file.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is written in <span id="komputer">C++</span>, and I put roughly 30 hours into it.
          Although his code isn't used anymore, my good friend <a href="https://github.com/wh4ky" id="github">Wh4cky</a>
          wrote
          the first version (the current version is <span id="komputer">4.0.0</span>).

          When I turned 16 years old in december, one of my friends, who is way better with computers than anyone I
          know, gifted
          me this domain.
          Exactly 20 days later, it was ready to acces and for me to use. I plan on submitting this to the <span
            id="komputer">High Seas</span> program when I feel content with the contents and the layout. <br />
          The name of the domain is <span id="linguist">"geen-dolfijn"</span>, which is <span id="linguist">Dutch</span>
          for
          "no-dolphin".

          Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:<br>
          More pages: I want this website to me an accurate representation of me, so it must include serious and
          non-serious things.<br>
          A way to let you, the reader, try my projects without leaving this very site.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is written in <span id="komputer">HTML</span> and <span id="komputer">CSS</span>, and I have put
          roughly 30+ hours into it. My friend Jsw helped me with the setup, and why not check out his GitHub, he has
          a
          very cool discord bot: <a href="https://github.com/jsw08" id="github">jsw</a>.

          I wanted to put a webversion of this project on my site, so I got into TypeScript and Svelte and I am
          currently making one. It is hard.

        <p class="nob">
          The things that still need to be implemented are: <br>
          Making the practising stop after the desired amount of words, <br>
          Adding more settings and actually making them do stuff.

          18/03/2025: Development is going good. It is really complicated but the start is there.

          What is the integral from 0 to positive infinity of the function x^(-x) dx? That is a question I am dying to

          If you know anything that might be of any help, please contact me! I am pretty stuck.
