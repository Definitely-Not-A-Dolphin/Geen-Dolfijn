      <p class="not">
        To practise both my <span id="linguist">Finnish</span> and my <span id="komputer">C++</span> skills, I made the
        Finnish Language Trainer (Formerly Finnish Idiom Trainer).
        It makes use of <span id="komputer">(i)fstream</span> to store all the words and their translations in seperate <span
          id="komputer">csv-files</span>.
        It currently supports the "first" <span id="linguist">five cases</span> of the Finnish Language: <span
          id="linguist">Nominatiivi, Genetiivi, Akkusatiivi, Partitiivi, Inessiivi.</span>
        There are also some files that store grammar explainations, but they aren't finished. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p class="nob">
        Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
      <ul class="not">
        <li>
          Colors, since everything happens in the terminal, colors can help organising all the text, and it looks
          aesthetically pleasing.
        </li>
        <li>
          More grammar explainations: Finnish is known for its <span id="linguist">complex grammar</span>, both for <span
            id="linguist">cases</span> and for <span id="linguist">verbs</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A way to practise numbers up to a million, but without having to type the first million numbers out in a
          file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is written in <span id="komputer">C++</span>, and I put roughly 30 hours into it.
        Although his code isn't used anymore, my good friend <a href="https://github.com/wh4ky" id="github">Wh4cky</a> wrote
        the first version (the current version is <span id="komputer">4.0.0</span>).

      <h2 class="nob not">This website</h2>
      <p class="not">
        When I turned 16 years old in december, one of my friends, who is way better with computers than anyone I know, gifted
        me this domain.
        Exactly 20 days later, it was ready to acces and for me to use. I plan on submitting this to the <span
          id="komputer">High Seas</span> program when I feel content with the contents and the layout. <br />
        The name of the domain is <span id="linguist">"geen-dolfijn"</span>, which is <span id="linguist">Dutch</span> for
        "no-dolphin".
      </p>
      <p class="nob">
        Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
      <ul class="not">
        <li>A better layout. I am content with the simplicity it has now, but I do not think some images or a side bar would
          be a bad addition.
        </li>
        <li>
          More pages: I want this website to me an accurate representation of me, so it must include serious and non-serious
          things.
        </li>
        <li>
          A way to let you, the reader, try my projects without leaving this very site.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is written in <span id="komputer">HTML</span> and <span id="komputer">CSS</span>, and I have put roughly 6
        hours into it.
        My friend Jsw helped me with the setup, and why not check out his GitHub, he has a very cool discord bot: <a
          href="https://github.com/jsw08" id="github">jsw</a>.
