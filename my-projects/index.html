  <h1>My Projects</h1>
  <p>
    These are all the (big) projects I am making / have made. Take a look!
  </p>
  
  <h2>Finnish Language Trainer</h2>
  <p>
    To practise both my Finnish skills and my C++ skills, I made the Finnish Language Trainer (Formerly Finnish Idiom Trainer). 
    It makes use of (i)fstream to store all the words and their translations in seperate csv-files.
    It currently supports the "first" five cases of the Finnish Language: Nominatiivi, Genetiivi, Akkusatiivi, Partitiivi, Inessiivi.
    There are also some files that store grammar explainations, but they aren't finished. <br /><br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
    <ul>
      <li>Colors, since everything happens in the terminal, colors can help organising all the text, and it looks aesthetically pleasing.<br /></li>
      <li>More grammar explainations: Finnish is known for its complex grammar, both for cases and for verbs.<br /></li>
      <li>A way to practise numbers up to a million, but without having to type the first million numbers out in a file.<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is written in C++, and I put roughly 30 hours into it. 
    Although his code isn't used anymore, my good friend <a href="https://github.com/wh4ky" id="github">Wh4cky</a> wrote the first version (the current version is 4.0.0).

  <h2>This website</h2>
  <p>
    When I turned 16 years old in december, one of my friends, who is way better with computers than anyone I know, gifted me this domain.
    Exactly 20 days later, it was ready to acces and for me to use. I plan on submitting this to the High Seas program when I feel content with the contents and the layout. <br />
    The name of the domain is "geen-dolfijn", which is Dutch for "no-dolphin".
  </p>
  <p>
    Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
    <ul>
      <li>A better layout. I am content with the simplicity it has now, but I do not think some images or a side bar would be a bad addition.<br /></li>
      <li>More pages: I want this website to me an accurate representation of me, so it must include serious and non-serious things.<br /></li>
      <li>A way to let you, the reader, try my projects without leaving this very site.<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is written in HTML and CSS, and I have put roughly 6 hours into it.
    My friend Jsw helped me with the setup, and why not check out his GitHub, he has a very cool discord bot: <a href="https://github.com/jsw08" id="github">jsw</a>.
