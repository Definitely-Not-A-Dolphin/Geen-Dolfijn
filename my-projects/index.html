  <h1>My Projects</h1>
  <p2>
    These are all the (big) projects I am making / have made. Take a look!
  </p2>
  
  <h3>Finnish Language Trainer</h3>
  <p2>
    To practise both my Finnish skills and my C++ skills, I made the Finnish Language Trainer (Formerly Finnish Idiom Trainer). 
    It makes use of (i)fstream to store all the words and their translations. It supports the "first" five cases of the Finnish Language: Nominatiivi, Genetiivi, Akkusatiivi, Partitiivi, Inessiivi.
    There are also some files that store grammar explainations, but they aren't finished. <br />< br />
  </p2>
  <p2>
    Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
    <ul>
      <li>Colors, since everything happens in the terminal, colors can help organising all the text, and it looks aesthetically pleasing.<br /></li>
      <li>More grammar explainations: Finnish is known for its complex grammat, both for cases and for verbs.<br /></li>
      <li>A way to practise numbers up to a million, but without having to type the first million numbers out in a file.<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </p2>
  <p2>
    This is written in C++, and I put roughly 20 hours into it. 
    Although his code isn't used anymore, my good friend <a href="https://github.com/wh4ky">Wh4cky</a> wrote the first version (the current version is 4.0.0).

  <h3>This website (HTML & CSS)</h3>
  <p2>
    When I turned 16 years old in december, one of my friends, who is way better with computers than anyone I know, gifted me this domain.
    Exactly 20 days later, it was ready to acces and for me to use. I plan on submitting this to the High Seas program when I feel content with the contents and the layout. <br />
    The name of the domain is "geen-dolfijn", which is Dutch for "no-dolphin".
  </p2>
  <p2>
    Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
    <ul>
      <li>A better layout. I am content with the simplicity is has now, but I do not think some images or a side bar would be a bad addition.<br /></li>
      <li>More pages: I want this website to me an accurate representation of me, so it must include serious and non-serious things.<br /></li>
      <li>A way to let you, the reader, try my projects without leaving this very site.<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </p2>
  <p2>
    This site is written in HTML and CSS, and I have put roughly 6 hours into it.
    My friend Jsw helped me with the setup, and why not check out his GitHub, he has a very cool discord bot: <a href="https://github.com/jsw08">jsw</a>.
