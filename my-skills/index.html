        <h1 class="not nob">My Skills</h1>
        <p>
          I have a lot of interests, but I think I can classify only two as skills: mathematics and programming.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item main">
        <h3 id="math" class="nob">Mathematics</h3>
        <p class="not nob">
          I find mathematiks really interesting. My favorite topics are:
          <span id="math">Calculus</span>: I find integrals particularly interesting.<br>
          <span id="math">Formal Logic</span>: ZFC-set theory is something I really want to understand, but it is a bit
          too
          complicated for me to really start with.<br>
          <span id="math">Number Theory</span>: Proving different numerical theorems is a perfect puzzle. I really enjoy
          doing that.<br>
          <span id="math">Complex Analysis</span>: When Desmos added complex numbers I actually thought it was fake. I
          immediately started to play around with different functions and how they plot.
          Complex Analysis is a combination of calculus and <span id="math">complex numbers</span>, two of my favorite
          things
          in math.<br>

        <h3 id="komputer" class="nob">Programming</h3>
        <p class="not nob">
          Since a some time I have picked up Programming again. The languages I know are:
          <span id="komputer">Python</span> (50%): we had to learn python in school, so I know my way around it.<br>
          <span id="komputer">C++</span> (30%): When I wasn't content with the decimal precision in python while writing
          programs I decided to learn C++. I chose for C++ because I thought it was important to know.
          Now, my biggest project yet, the <span id="komputer">Finnish Language Trainer</span>, is written in C++ and
          makes
          use of <span id="komputer">fstream</span>, <span id="komputer">vectors</span>, <span id="komputer">random
            numbers</span> and <span id="komputer">switches</span>.<br>
          <span id="komputer">HTML</span> (15%): I need to know HTML to create this very website, so it speaks for
          itself. I
          do got the hang of it, but I think there is way more to know.<br>
          <span id="komputer">CSS</span> (10%): CSS is also important for webdev, and a good layout is extremely
          important
          for a good impression.<br>
          <span id="komputer">JavaScript</span> (0.1%): console.log("Hello World"); is no joke the only thing I know.
          I do not think that it fullfills the premise of this list, but I do have to know it for both school and this
          site,
          so I decided to just include it anyway.
          You can find the projects I am currently doing <a href="https://geen-dolfijn.nl/my-projects">here</a>.<br>
