  <h1>My Skills</h1>
  <p>
    I have a lot of interests, but I think I can classify only two as skills: mathematics and programming.
  </p>

  <h2>My Skills</h2>
  <h3 id="math">Mathematics</h3>
  <p>
    I find mathematiks really interesting. My favorite topics are:
    <ul>
      <li><span id="math">Calculus</span>: I find integrals particularly interesting.</li>
      <li><span id="math">Formal Logic</span>: ZFC-set theory is something I really want to understand, but it is a bit too complicated for me to really start with.</li>
      <li><span id="math">Number Theory</span>: Proving different numerical theorems is a perfect puzzle. I really enjoy doing that.</li>
      <li><span id="math">Complex Analysis</span>: When Desmos added complex numbers I actually thought it was fake. I immediately started to play around with different functions and how they plot. 
        Complex Analysis is a combination of calculus and <span id="math">complex numbers</span>, two of my favorite things in math.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="komputer">Programming</h3>
  <p>
    Since a month I have started to really get into Programming. The languages I know are:
    <ul>
      <li><span id="komputer">Python</span> (50%): we had to learn python in school, so I know my way around it.</li>
      <li><span id="komputer">C++</span> (30%): When I wasn't content with the decimal precision in python while writing programs I decided to learn C++. I chose for C++ because I thought it was important to know.
        Now, my biggest project yet, the <span id="komputer">Finnish Language Trainer</span>, is written in C++ and makes use of <span id="komputer">fstream</span>, <span id="komputer">vectors</span>, <span id="komputer">random numbers</span> and <span id="komputer">switches</span>. 
      </li>
      <li><span id="komputer">HTML</span> (15%): I need to know HTML to create this very website, so it speaks for itself. I do got the hang of it, but I think there is way more to know.</li>
      <li><span id="komputer">CSS</span> (10%): CSS is also important for webdev, and a good layout is extremely important for a good impression.</li>
      <li><span id="komputer">JavaScript</span> (0.1%): console.log("Hello World"); is no joke the only thing I know. 
        I do not think that it fullfills the premise of this list, but I do have to know it for both school and this site, so I decided to just include it anyway.</li>
    </ul>
