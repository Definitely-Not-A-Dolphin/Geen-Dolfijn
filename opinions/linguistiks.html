      <div class="item main">
        <h2 id="linguist" class="not nob">We need to add more letters to the English Alphabet</h2>
        <p class="not">
          The English language is incredibly inconsistent with its spelling. To improve on this, I think that we should
          add new letters (from other languages or from the IPA) to English.<br /><br />
          Lets start with the <span id="linguist">unvoiced dental fricative</span> and the <span id="linguist">voiced
            dental fricative</span>.
          The unvoiced dental fricative is the /th/-sound in "think", and "thin".
          We should replace this with the letter þorn (þ, Þ), which at one point was actually used in English until the
          days of the printing press.
          The voiced dental fricative is also a /th/-sound, but now as in "the" and "that". We can replace þis with the
          letter eð (ð, Ð).
          Boþ of ðese letters are still used in Icelandic, a in my opinion fairly underrated language. <br /> <br />

          From now on, I will try to use ðese letters (no promises ðo).
