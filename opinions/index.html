            Although <span id="math">mathematics</span> is a pure and objective
            subject, here are my pure and objective opinions.

            6 is like the best number and if you do not agree you are wrong.
          </h2>
          <p class="not">
            6 is the smallest <span id="math">perfect number</span>. What is a
            perfect number you may ask? A perfect number is a number of which
            the sum of its proper denominaters equals the number itself. for 6's
            <span id="math">proper denominators</span> are 1, 2 and 3, and since
            1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 6 is perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also the highest number that has more denominators than not.
            The denominators of 6 are 6, 3, 2 and 1, which also makes it a
            <span id="math">highly composite number</span>.
          </p>
          <p>Every natural number power of 6 ends in the number 6.</p>
          <p>
            Using base six (seximal, not senary) we can count up to 50 (30 in
            decimal) on our hands. How to do that is left as an excersise to the
            reader. Because 6 has so many denominators, seximal numbers (number
            is base 6 that involve decimal) are easier to write.
          </p>

            Bees make hexagonic patterns, since a hexagon has the highest
            <span id="math">area : perimeter ratio</span>
            out of the polygons that can tile a plane. A hexagon is also the
            only tileable polygon that cannot be constructed out of smaller
            copies of itself. The same cannot be said for the other two tileable
            polygons: squares and triangles.

            enough to have opinions about it.

            We need to add more letters to the English Alphabet
          </h2>
          <p class="not">
            The English language is incredibly inconsistent with its spelling.
            To improve on this, I think that we should add new letters (from
            other languages or from the IPA) to English.<br /><br />
            Lets start with the
            <span id="linguist">unvoiced dental fricative</span> and the
            <span id="linguist">voiced dental fricative</span>. The unvoiced
            dental fricative is the /th/-sound in "think", and "thin". We should
            replace this with the letter þorn (þ, Þ), which at one point was
            actually used in English until the days of the printing press. The
            voiced dental fricative is also a /th/-sound, but now as in "the"
            and "that". We can replace þis with the letter eð (ð, Ð). Boþ of
            ðese letters are still used in Icelandic, a in my opinion fairly
            underrated language. <br />
            <br />

            From now on, I will try to use ðese letters (no promises ðo).
