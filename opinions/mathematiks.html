  <h2>6 is like the best number and if you do not agree you are wrong.</h2>
  <p2>
    6 is the smallest perfect number. What is a perfect number you may ask? A perfect number is a number of which the sum of its proper denominaters equals the number itself.
    for 6's proper denominators are 1, 2 and 3, and since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 6 is perfect. 
    
    It is also the highest number that has more denominators than not. 
    The denominators of 6 are 6, 3, 2 and 1, which also makes it a highly composite number.  

    Every natural number power of 6 ends in the number 6.

    Using base six (seximal, not senary) we can count up to 50 (30 in decimal) on our hands. How to do that is left as an excersise to the reader.
    Because 6 has so many denominators, seximal numbers (number is base 6 that involve decimal) are easier to write.
