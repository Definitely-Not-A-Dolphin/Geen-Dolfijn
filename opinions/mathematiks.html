        <p>
          Although <span id="math">mathematics</span> is a pure and objective subject, here are my pure and objective opinions.
        </p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="item main">
        <h2 class="nob">6 is like the best number and if you do not agree you are wrong.</h2>
        <p class="not">
          6 is the smallest <span id="math">perfect number</span>. What is a perfect number you may ask? A perfect number is a
          number of which the sum of its proper denominaters equals the number itself.
          for 6's <span id="math">proper denominators</span> are 1, 2 and 3, and since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 6 is perfect.
        </p><p>
          It is also the highest number that has more denominators than not.
          The denominators of 6 are 6, 3, 2 and 1, which also makes it a <span id="math">highly composite number</span>.
        </p><p>
          Every natural number power of 6 ends in the number 6.
        </p><p>
          Using base six (seximal, not senary) we can count up to 50 (30 in decimal) on our hands. How to do that is left as an
          excersise to the reader.
          Because 6 has so many denominators, seximal numbers (number is base 6 that involve decimal) are easier to write.
        </p><p>
          Bees make hexagonic patterns, since a hexagon has the highest <span id="math">area : perimeter ratio</span> out of the
          polygons that can tile a plane. A hexagon is also the only tileable polygon that cannot be constructed out of smaller
          copies of itself.
          The same cannot be said for the other two tileable polygons: squares and triangles.
