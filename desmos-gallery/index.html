          My submission for the 2024 Desmos Art Contest explicitly showed my love for hexagons.
          Bees will go from left to right following some interesting functions that involve trigonometrics, hyperbolic
          trigonometrics, the error function, and more.

          A portret of Cagney Carnation (the flower from the my mom when guests / my mom when alone) from Cuphead.
          I made it with roughly 120 Bezier (I don't know where the accents go) curves. It took me roughly 12 hours.
